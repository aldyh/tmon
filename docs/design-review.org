i want you to look at this project with fresh eyes (everything but the
internal structure of panel/, as that's just a demo). give me honest
feedback on the overall feel, what works, what doesn't, what to
continue doing in future projects, what to avoid in future work. be
very critical as designer. i want feedback from a design and
engineering stand point. write your analysis by filling out the rest of
this file... on a branch.
