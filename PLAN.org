#+STARTUP: showall

* Project plan

Goal: a small, robust temperature monitoring system where a Raspberry Pi polls a few ESP32 nodes over RS-485, stores readings locally, and is easy to test without hardware.

** Assumptions

- 1-4 ESP32 sensors, each with up to 4 NTC thermistors.
- A USB <-> RS-485 adapter on the Pi.
- SQLite is sufficient
- Protocol is custom binary as defined in ~docs/protocol.org~.

** Conventions

- *Python (server):* Python 3.11+, minimal deps (prefer stdlib; ~pyserial~ is expected).
- *Config:* ~config-485.toml~, ~config-udp.toml~ (stdlib ~tomllib~ in Python 3.11).
- *Testing:*
  - Unit tests: ~pytest~ with fakes/mocks (no hardware).
  - Integration tests: ~socat~ + serial simulator (~server/tools~).
- *Firmware (sensor):* PlatformIO + Arduino framework; keep firmware straightforward.

** Milestones

Use this as the canonical checklist. Keep it up to date as work is completed.

*** Setup coding guidelines
- [X] Coding guidlines are GNU for C/C++.  Look up what that means, especially space after function
names.  Braces on lone line, but are indented one more level.  typedef/struct have braces
on next line, but on column 0.  Look it up.
- [X] For python document each method/class with docstrings.
- [X] Document each argument and retval.
- [X] For main API methods, and toplevel externally visible functions include usage/code examples.
- [X] Update CLAUDE.md to include coding guidelines accordingly described above.

*** Production directory layout and config resolution

Before anything can be installed, the code needs to know where to find
config and data in both dev and production contexts.

- [X] Define layout: ~/etc/tmon/~ for config, ~/var/lib/tmon/~ for data + firmware
- [X] Config path resolution: check repo-local first, fall back to ~/etc/tmon/~
- [X] Database path: repo-local ~tmon.db~ for dev, ~/var/lib/tmon/tmon.db~ for production
- [X] Panel reads DB from same resolved path (no separate config needed)

Full automation: ~make install~ runs ~install.sh~ which handles everything.

- [X] ~install.sh~: create ~tmon~ user, create ~/etc/tmon/~ and ~/var/lib/tmon/~
- [X] ~install.sh~: pip install server package, copy config files
- [X] ~install.sh~: install firmware binaries to ~/var/lib/tmon/firmware/~

*** Rename master/slave to server/sensor

- [X] Rename throughout: code, config, docs, directory names, README
- [X] Verify all tests pass after rename

*** Hardware bring-up (NTC + UDP smoke test)

First real hardware validation.  Do this over UDP since it avoids
RS-485 wiring complexity.

- [ ] Wire NTC to breadboard on one ESP32
- [ ] Verify temperatures are sane

*** Serial bring-up (plain UART, no RS-485)

Validate serial protocol on real hardware without RS-485 transceiver
complexity.  Connect ESP32 TX/RX directly to the Pi UART (GPIO
crossover).  DE/RE are output-only in the firmware, so they can be
left unwired.

- [ ] Wire ESP32 TX/RX to Pi UART (crossover: TX->RX, RX->TX, common GND)
- [ ] Server polls sensor over serial, receives valid temperature readings
- [ ] Verify round-trip works reliably (no CRC errors, no timeouts)

*** Integration + polish

- [X] Document how to add a new sensor (address + wiring + config)
- [X] Confirm error handling (CRC errors, timeouts, missing devices) is reasonable
- [X] Check LED behavior sanity (stub vs real hardware alignment)
- [X] Add readings table index (~CREATE INDEX idx_readings_addr_ts ON readings(addr, ts)~)
- [X] Verify flashing a brand-new ESP32 works from a deployed Pi (no dev environment)
- [ ] Final pass: remove unused code, clean up comments, ensure docs match behavior

*** Full firmware (RS-485)

- [ ] RS-485 transceiver enable/disable control (DE/RE) with correct timing
- [ ] Respond to requests; populate payload with temperature readings
- [ ] Real device responds reliably on a physical RS-485 bus
- [ ] Real bus smoke test with 1 sensor -> then scale to all sensors
