* tmon: A temperature monitoring system

** Overview

A small, home-use *Raspberry Pi + ESP32* setup for monitoring
temperatures over *RS-485* or *WiFi*.

- *Server (Raspberry Pi):* Python daemon that collects readings from ESP32 clients and stores them in an SQLite database.
- *Transport:* RS-485 (USB adapter, server polls) or UDP over WiFi (clients push).
- *Clients (ESP32):* Each reads up to *4 NTC thermistors*.  Only the
  S3-DevKitC-1 version has been tested; pre-built firmware targets
  this model.
- *Protocol:* Simple custom binary frames with *CRC-16/MODBUS*.

Three services run on the Pi: a serial daemon that polls RS-485 clients, a UDP daemon that receives pushes from WiFi clients, and a web dashboard.  You can mix and match transport modes, but each client must have a unique address (see [[*Flashing client firmware][Flashing client firmware]]).  Readings are stored in an SQLite database (see [[file:docs/storage.org][Storage Specification]]) and viewable from the web dashboard.

** Architecture

#+begin_example
                Raspberry Pi
  .-------------------------------------------.
  |  RS-485 server     (tmond-serial)         |
  |  WiFi server       (tmond-udp)            |
  |  web panel         (tmon-panel)           |
  |  database           (tmon.db)             |
  '-+---------------------------------------+-'
    |                                       |
    |  RS-485 bus                    WiFi (UDP)
    |                                       |
    +--+-------+-------+          +---------+---------+
       |       |       |          |                   |
     +---+   +---+   +---+      +---+               +---+
     | 1 |   | 4 |   | 5 |      | 2 |               | 3 |
     +---+   +---+   +---+      +---+               +---+

  [N] = ESP32 client at address N (up to 4 NTC thermistors each)
#+end_example

See the [[file:docs/wiring.org][Wiring Reference]] for how to connect the ESP32 clients, thermistors, and RS-485 bus.

** Installation

Installation is meant to be done on the Raspberry Pi, since that is
where you will likely deploy.  You can do so with:

#+begin_example
# On the Pi:
git clone https://github.com/aldyh/tmon.git
cd tmon
make
sudo make install
#+end_example

The installer copies default config files to ~/etc/tmon/~, pre-built firmware binaries to ~/var/lib/tmon/firmware/~, and supporting files to ~/var/lib/tmon/~.  The servers are meant to be run from systemd and are installed but *not* enabled -- see [[*Running][Running]].

** Configuration

Config files live in ~/etc/tmon/~:

- ~config-485.toml~ -- RS-485 transport: serial port, baud rate, client list, polling interval.
- ~config-udp.toml~ -- UDP transport: listen port, push interval.
- ~wifi.toml~ -- WiFi credentials for UDP clients (copy from ~wifi.toml.example~ and fill in).

** Running

Enable the two daemons (one for UDP and one for serial):

#+begin_example
sudo systemctl enable --now tmond-serial   # RS-485 transport
sudo systemctl enable --now tmond-udp      # UDP push transport
#+end_example

Enable the web dashboard:

#+begin_example
sudo systemctl enable --now tmon-panel     # accessible at http://<host>:5000
#+end_example

Check status and logs:

#+begin_example
systemctl status tmond-serial
systemctl status tmond-udp
journalctl -u tmond-serial -f
journalctl -u tmond-udp -f
#+end_example

** Flashing client firmware

Connect an ESP32 to the Pi via USB, then use ~tmon-flash~ to flash it.  Each client must have a unique address:

#+begin_example
tmon-flash --mode=serial --addr=1          # RS-485 client at address 1
tmon-flash --mode=udp --addr=5             # UDP client at address 5
#+end_example

The tool auto-detects the serial port, but you can use ~--port=/dev/ttyACM0~ to
override.

The built-in LED on each ESP32 signals operational status:

| Color           | Meaning                           |
|-----------------+-----------------------------------|
| Off             | Normal operation                  |
| Blinking red    | WiFi disconnected (UDP only)      |
| Blinking green  | Sending readings to server        |
| Blinking yellow | Identify: blinks N times (N=addr) |

Pressing the boot button triggers the identify sequence: the LED
blinks yellow N times, where N is the client address.  This lets you
verify which address a device has after flashing.

** Uninstalling

To uninstall:

#+begin_example
# Keep /etc/tmon, /var/lib/tmon and other configury
sudo make uninstall

# Remove everything.
sudo deploy/uninstall.sh --purge
#+end_example

** Development

For local hacking -- these targets use local venvs and do not require
a system-wide install.

*** Build and test

#+begin_example
make                  # create venvs + deps
make check            # run all test suites (no hardware needed)
#+end_example

*** Run locally

To run the servers on the development environment without installing first:

#+begin_example
make run-server-485   # RS-485 (uses server/config-485.toml)
make run-server-udp   # UDP push (uses server/config-udp.toml)
make demo-server      # panel with mock data at http://localhost:5000
#+end_example

*** Building firmware from source

The pre-built firmware is included in the repository, but if you need to rebuild it (requires [[https://platformio.org/][PlatformIO]] on an x86 machine):

#+begin_example
# On the dev machine:
make firmware         # build ESP32 binaries into firmware/
scp -r firmware/ pi:~/tmon/
#+end_example

Then re-run ~sudo make install~ on the Pi to update the installed firmware.
