#+STARTUP: overview

* INSTRUCTIONS
This is your TODO list for the project, apart from milestones which are in PLAN.org.

You can ignore this file unless asked to work on a TODO item.

When asked to work on an item, work on a new branch as per the guidelines in CLAUDE.md.  First, come up with a plan, run it by me first, and when we agree on the approach, start implementing it.

When working on a TODO item, constrain yourself to the item at hand.  No fly-by refactors, etc.

New items go at the bottom of the file.  Work through items top to bottom within the TODO section.

The TODO item itself will contain the instructions itself.

Usual commit guidelines per this project apply as described in CLAUDE.md.

As part of the commit mark the item as DONE in this file, and update any milestones that may need updating in PLAN.org.

Add a subsection in the item named "Notes", of anything interesting that came up during working on this item, that might be useful to keep in the archived DONE item.
* DONE Inconsistent error handling philosophy

The protocol layer uses exceptions (Python) / return codes (C) for
validation errors, but the poller layer silently swallows them:

#+begin_example
# poller.py:87-91
try:
    reply = decode_frame(raw)
except ValueError as exc:
    log.debug("bad frame from slave %d: %s", addr, exc)
    return None
#+end_example

Returning ~None~ for all error conditions (timeout, bad CRC, bad
address, unexpected command) loses information. A caller cannot
distinguish "slave offline" from "slave sent garbage." For a home
project this is acceptable, but it would be a problem at scale.

** Notes
Closed as working as designed.  Returning None for all failure modes
is intentional: callers only need "got data" or "didn't get data";
diagnostic details are logged.  Added a one-line comment in poller.py
documenting this choice.
* DONE Convert markdown files to org mode
Convert all *.md files in the project to .org mode, with the exception of CLAUDE.md
which is needed for convention.

** Notes
Converted README.md, PLAN.md, docs/protocol.md, docs/storage.md, docs/wiring.md.
Updated all cross-references in CLAUDE.md, Python docstrings, and test comments.
* DONE Avoid documenting obvious things
Change coding guidelines in CLAUDE.md to avoid documenting obvious things.  Say, a 3-4 line method shouldn't have extensive documentation. A sentence is fine.  No need to document each arg, etc.

Instead for small methods, just write a small sentence on what the function does, and
put some sort of attr as to what arg types are.  For example:

def _require_str(raw: dict[str, object], key: str) -> None:
    """Validate that *key* exists in *raw* and is a str."""

^^^^ no need to document each and every arg.

Actually, when method is obvious enough, the above format is good enough.

Change all code in project accordingly.

** Notes
Replaced verbose Args/Returns sections with type hints in signatures for
short/obvious methods. Kept Google-style sections on main API functions
(encode_request, decode_frame, parse_reply_payload, load_config, poll,
poll_all, run) but trimmed redundant arg docs where the signature suffices.
Updated CLAUDE.md guidelines to reflect the lighter approach.
* DONE Come up with web panel plan.
Familiarize with entire project, and suggest a few ways to visualize this data.
I'd like a web panel where we can see current readings, and also an option to view historical data.
Give me the 2-3 most useful ways of visualizing this data, and document it in docs/panel.org with clear subsections, explaining each option and what the benefits and drawbacks are in terms of style, maintainability, heavy usage of libraries, etc.

Provide a summary at the top (sub section in org mode) where you explain that the reader/system is free to ignore this entire file as it's just random musings, but do give a hint of where we're going with this project (that we'll need a visualization framework).

** Notes
Documented three options in docs/panel.org:
- A: Flask + HTMX (server-rendered, near-zero JS)
- B: Flask + Chart.js (JSON API + client-rendered charts)
- C: Grafana + SQLite plugin (full dashboarding tool)
Recommended Option B as the best balance of interactivity, simplicity,
and testability.  Option C noted but too heavy for this project.
* DONE Implement mock visualization panel
look at docs/panel.org.  i'm interested in option B, but only to see
how it would feel.  in a branch, work on a mock implementation that
reads from the db in the project (populate it with random reasonable
data for a year worth of readings).  put everything, including
dependencies, in a directory so i can start some sort of server, and
point my web browser at it, and play around with it.  write any design
and notes in this item under the Notes section.

i want to see how stuff would actually look and work.

** Notes
Implemented as Option B (Flask + Chart.js) in panel/ directory.
Self-contained: own venv, own pyproject.toml, no imports from master/.

- ~make demo-server~ generates data and starts the server in one step.
- ~make check-demo~ runs 22 tests (6 for data generation, 16 for API).
- generate_data.py creates ~3M rows (3 slaves, 30s intervals, 365 days).
- Temperature profiles: sinusoidal daily/seasonal cycles + Gaussian noise.
- Slave 3 channel 1 has 5% null rate to exercise null handling.
- Time windows relative to newest DB row, so data always appears live.
- Chart.js vendored at 4.4.7 (~206 KB), no CDN dependency.
- Dark industrial/SCADA theme: navy background, monospace font, flat panels.
* DONE Get rid of "payload" arguments in code base
Even though payload is the right terminology for method arguments, we're always talking about temperatures.
Perhaps rename this to something dealing with temperatures.  Choose something clean, short, and obvious.

This is for the method arguments.  I don't care what you do inside the code...for example tests.

** Notes
Renamed the temperature-specific function and its parameters:
- Function: ~parse_reply_payload~ -> ~parse_reply~ (C: ~tmon_parse_reply_payload~ -> ~tmon_parse_reply~)
- Parameter names (~payload~, ~payload_len~) kept as-is -- the argument is an
  opaque blob, not structured temperature data
- Left protocol-framing names (~encode_request~, ~decode_frame~, constants) unchanged
  since those describe the generic protocol, not temperature data.
* DONE Fix stale protocol.md references in C files
~slave/include/protocol.h~ (line 5) and ~slave/src/protocol.c~ (line 4) still
reference ~docs/protocol.md~ -- should be ~docs/protocol.org~ since the
markdown-to-org conversion.

** Notes
Updated both files to reference docs/protocol.org.
* DONE Poller.poll duplicates parse_reply logic
~poller.py:99-105~ manually unpacks the REPLY payload (struct.unpack loop,
PROTO_TEMP_INVALID check) instead of calling ~parse_reply()~ from
~protocol.py~.  The same logic already exists in ~parse_reply~.  Use it.

** Notes
Modified poll() to call parse_reply() and convert temperatures back to raw
int16 values (multiply by 10). Removed unused struct import.
* DONE Deduplicate _make_reply test helper
~master/tests/test_poller.py:16~ and ~master/tests/test_daemon.py:13~ define
identical ~_make_reply(addr, t0, t1, t2, t3)~ helpers.  Move to ~conftest.py~.

** Notes
Moved helper to conftest.py as make_reply() (without underscore prefix since
it's now shared). Updated imports in test_poller.py and test_daemon.py.
* DONE Remove unused import sys in generate_data.py
~panel/generate_data.py~ imports ~sys~ (line 20) but never uses it.

** Notes
Removed the unused import.
* DONE Move datetime imports to module level
~panel/app.py~ imports ~from datetime import ...~ inside two route functions
(lines 110, 179).  ~panel/build_demo.py~ does the same (lines 89, 128).
Move to the top of each file.

** Notes
Moved datetime/timedelta/timezone imports to module level in both files.
* DONE Trim verbose docstrings on test doubles
The "avoid documenting obvious things" cleanup (branch 012) didn't reach
test code.  These test helpers still have full Args/Returns sections on
one-line methods:
- ~master/tests/conftest.py~: FakeBus.send, .receive, .__init__
- ~master/tests/test_daemon.py~: CountingBus and MultiBus (every method)
- ~master/tests/test_poller.py~: _make_reply
- ~master/tests/test_config.py~: _write_toml
One-liner docstrings (or none) suffice for these.

** Notes
Replaced verbose Args/Returns sections with one-liner docstrings and type
hints in signatures. FakeBus, CountingBus, MultiBus, _write_toml all trimmed.
make_reply (formerly _make_reply) was moved to conftest and trimmed there.
* DONE Trim obvious-command documentation in org files
Several docs explain what competent readers can see from the Makefile:
- ~README.org~ lines 47-63: spells out what ~make build-master~, ~make
  build-slave~, ~make check-master~, ~make check-slave~ do.  The top-level
  ~make~ and ~make check~ lines are fine; the per-target breakdown adds
  little.
- ~panel/README.org~ "Quick start" section: ~make demo-setup~ and ~make
  demo-generate~ have inline comments that duplicate the Makefile.
  Consolidate to just ~make demo-server~ (which is the one that matters)
  and let the reader look at the Makefile for details.
Keep documentation that is non-obvious, like the API reference table in
~panel/README.org~ -- that's valuable.

** Notes
Removed per-target breakdown from README.org (build-master, build-slave,
check-master, check-slave). Removed demo-setup/demo-generate breakdown
from panel/README.org. Kept API reference table.
* DONE Retire docs/panel.org or move to an archive
~docs/panel.org~ was an exploratory design document comparing three
visualization options.  The decision was made (Option B) and is fully
implemented.  The file is historical noise now.  Either delete it or move
it to a ~docs/archive/~ directory so ~docs/~ only contains current specs.

** Notes
Deleted the file. The design rationale is preserved in the archived TODO
items that reference it.
* DONE Batch commits in poll_all

Each ~Storage.insert()~ call commits immediately.  For a poll cycle with
4 slaves, this means 4 separate transactions.  Batching into one commit
per cycle would reduce write overhead:

#+begin_example
# In Poller.poll_all, after the loop:
self._storage.commit()
#+end_example

This requires exposing ~commit()~ on Storage and removing the per-insert
commit.  Not critical at this scale, but it's a 3-line change that makes
the write pattern cleaner.

** Notes
Removed per-insert commit from Storage.insert(), added Storage.commit()
method, and poll_all() now calls commit() once after all inserts.
Updated storage tests to call commit() before fetch().
* DONE Duplicated CREATE TABLE SQL
The ~readings~ table schema appears in three places:
- ~master/src/tmon/storage.py~
- ~panel/generate_data.py~
- ~panel/tests/conftest.py~
Since panel deliberately avoids importing from master, this is somewhat
expected, but the generate_data.py copy could at least reference
docs/storage.org so a reader knows the schema is defined there.  Consider
adding a one-line comment in each copy pointing to the canonical schema in
~docs/storage.org~.

** Notes
- ~master/src/tmon/storage.py~ already referenced docs/storage.org in its
  module docstring, so no change needed there.
- Added ~# Schema: see docs/storage.org~ comment above _CREATE_TABLE in
  ~panel/generate_data.py~ and ~panel/tests/conftest.py~.
- Updated ~panel/generate_data.py~ docstring to reference docs/storage.org
  instead of master/src/tmon/storage.py.
* DONE Add "Bare UART test" milestone to PLAN.org
Insert between "Blink test" and "Full firmware" in the ESP32 firmware
section. This milestone validates UART communication before adding
RS-485 hardware complexity.

Checklist for the milestone:
- Document Pi UART setup in docs/wiring.org (disable BT, enable UART)
- ESP32 UART2 wired directly to Pi UART (TX->RX, RX->TX, GND)
- Firmware: configure UART on GPIO 16/17, toggle DE/RE on GPIO 5
- Echo test: ESP32 echoes received bytes
- Protocol test: ESP32 responds to POLL_REQUEST with dummy data
- Master talks to real ESP32 over /dev/serial0

** Notes
Milestone added to PLAN.org in commit 4848bc5.
* WAITING Missing index on readings table

- State "WAITING"    from "TODO"       [2026-02-04 Wed 11:13] \\
  This isn't urgent.
The ~readings~ table (schema/readings.sql) has no indexes beyond the
primary key.  The panel's ~/api/history~ and ~/api/export~ endpoints
filter by ~(addr, ts)~ range:

#+begin_example
SELECT ... FROM readings WHERE addr = ? AND ts >= ? AND ts <= ?
#+end_example

With a year of data (~3M rows per slave), this scans the full table.
Adding a composite index would help:

#+begin_example
CREATE INDEX idx_readings_addr_ts ON readings(addr, ts);
#+end_example

This is a straightforward change to ~schema/readings.sql~.  Existing
databases can be migrated with a one-time ~CREATE INDEX~ command.
* DONE Fragile schema loading path in storage.py

~storage.py~ loads the schema from ~schema/readings.sql~ using relative
path traversal:

#+begin_example
_SCHEMA_PATH = Path(__file__).resolve().parents[3] / "schema" / "readings.sql"
#+end_example

This works in development but would break if the package is pip-installed
to site-packages (the directory structure differs).

Options:
1. Embed the schema as a string constant in storage.py (simple, robust).
2. Use ~importlib.resources~ to load from a package data directory.

For a home project, option 1 is fine.  The schema is 12 lines and rarely
changes; keeping it inline avoids deployment edge cases.
* DONE Document Pi UART setup in wiring.org
Add a section for the Pi side GPIO UART configuration:
- /boot/firmware/config.txt: enable_uart=1, dtoverlay=disable-bt
- Disable serial console in /boot/firmware/cmdline.txt
- Result: /dev/serial0 available on GPIO 14 (TX) / GPIO 15 (RX)

Also document the wiring progression:

Phase 1 - Bare UART test:
  ESP32 GPIO 17 (TX) -> Pi GPIO 15 (RX)
  ESP32 GPIO 16 (RX) <- Pi GPIO 14 (TX)
  GND <-> GND
  ESP32 GPIO 5 (DE/RE) toggled but not connected

Phase 2 - With MAX485:
  Move wires from Pi GPIO to MAX485 (DI, RO, DE+RE, GND).
  Pi uses USB-RS485 adapter (/dev/ttyUSB0) instead of GPIO UART.

ESP32 wiring is identical in both phases - just the Pi side changes.

** Notes
Implemented in commit 4848bc5 as part of branch claude/031-esp32-s3-uart-docs.
* DONE Update wiring.org for ESP32-S3
The current wiring doc assumes ESP32-WROOM-32. Update pin assignments
for ESP32-S3:
- UART: GPIO 16 (RX), GPIO 17 (TX) - same pins as WROOM-32 but via GPIO matrix
- DE/RE: GPIO 5 - direction control for MAX485
- ADC1: GPIO 1-10 (channels 0-9) on S3, not GPIO 32-35
- Board: esp32-s3-devkitc-1

These pins work for both bare UART test and later MAX485 connection.
Defer until blink test passes and we confirm hardware works.

** Notes
Implemented in commit 4848bc5 as part of branch claude/031-esp32-s3-uart-docs.
* TODO YOLO with wifi!
Crazy idea, how about we add an option so we can test the entire
project over wifi, no cables.  Well, we'd still need to wire the NTC's to each esp32, but the esp32 and pis (or x86 linux) would talk over wifi.  Draft up a plan for the entire thing as a TODO item in TODO.org

Since we currently don't even have the rs485/uart implementation ready (it's just an echo stub), implement that as well as part of this work.  With some way where we can choose whether we're running in rs485/uart mode or wifi (as a parameter, or makefile target or whatever).

Implement it all in a branch.

Use your best judgement, following the style and goals of this project.  Ask few questions.

Use multiple small commits easy to review.  Use the guidelines for simplicity, etc in this project.

Make sure SSID/passwd can be set in toml (or somewhere configurable) for both client/server.  Make sure we can test with make file.  Implement the entire wifi client for the esp32 as it would ultimately work...

Can you do this, or is anything not clear?  Don't ask too many questions, but if anything absolutely needs clarification, ask now before you start.
